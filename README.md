<h2>Hi👋🏾, I am Temitope Victoria</h2>
<p>
I am a cloud engineer (Azure), and a technical writer skilled at managing and deploying cloud resources, writing and building documentation. I look forward to collaborating on cloud projects, technical writing and tech stories. I have the ability to work with a team to give value and build my skills. 

I am currently building docuementation with static site generators, and writing articles. I frequently publish articles on the little things I have come to learn on my <a href = "https://temitopevictoria.hashnode.dev//"> Hashnode </a>.
</p>

<p>
I am open to entry-level technical writing roles, to learning more and to being mentored. I am also available to collaborate on any projects.
</p>

<p>
Apart from coding, I like to think I am an exciting person in real life 😁. I am super into sports, athleticism and movies. I also love travelling around and learning about people, their language and culture.
