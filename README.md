<h2>Hi👋🏾, I am Temitope Victoria</h2>
<p>
I am a cloud engineer (Azure), and a technical writer skilled at managing and deploying cloud resources, writing and building documentation. I look forward to collaborating on cloud projects, technical writing, and tech stories. I have the ability to work with a team to give value and build my skills. 

I am currently building documentation with static site generators, and writing articles. I frequently publish articles on new technologies on my <a href = "https://temitopevictoria.hashnode.dev//"> Hashnode </a>.
</p>

<p>
I am open to entry-level technical writing roles,  learning more and being mentored. I am also available to collaborate on any project.
